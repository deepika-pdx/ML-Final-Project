# ML-Final-Project

In this project a Diabetes Prediction Model is built using the below machine learning techniques:

1. Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Multi-Layer Neural Network

The accuracy and performance of the models built using both the techniques is compared. The code for each of the technique is included in the respective folders.
